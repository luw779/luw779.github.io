<pre>
There   once was a man   from Peru.
Who dreamed he was eating his shoe.
He woke                up at night.
With a             terrible fright.
To find out his dream had come true!

<h1>Block and Inline Block Element</h1>
<p>Block element always startson a new line and takes up the full width of a page, from left to right. A block-level element can take up one line or multiple lines and has a line break before and after the element. And inline blick element does not cause a line break and does not take up the full width of a page, only the space bounded by its opening and closing tag. It is usually used within other HTML elements.</p>
