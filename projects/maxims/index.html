		<br><a class="emoji"><span class="color-change">Junk</span></a> deleted my account for <span class="fakelink">no</span> reason been working on it for 4 years, <span class="fakelink">no one</span> to get a hold of to help!!!! Complete f-ing <a class="emoji"><span class="color-change">junk</span></a> !!! - Updated Feb 6, 2019 </br>

		<br>My account says I need to verify my phone number but it never send my the text with the code like it says it does! <span class="fakelink">Cannot</span> contact anyone about this either! <a class="emoji"><span class="color-change">Crazy</span></a> ! - Updated Feb 2, 2019 </br>

		<br>Absolutely <a class="emoji"><span class="color-change">disgusting</span></a> , someone accessed mine and my friends DM's and shared them. - Updated Jan 10, 2019 </br>

		<br><span class="fakelink">Don’t</span> think it’s right when people put <a class="emoji"><span class="color-change">inappropriate</span></a> pics on Instagram or <a class="emoji"><span class="color-change">inappropriate</span></a> messages. - Updated Jan 9, 2019 </br>

		<br>I installed <span class="instagram">instagram</span> today on my iPhone XR, but when I try to open the app it closes please make and hotfix so you <span class="fakelink">won't</span> lose users!! - Updated Jan 7, 2019 </br>

		<br><a class="emoji"><span class="color-change">Hate</span></a> <a class="emoji"><span class="color-change">hate</span></a> <a class="emoji"><span class="color-change">hate</span></a> the new side swipe action. <a class="emoji"><span class="color-change">Hate</span></a> it!!! Please change it back. <span class="fakelink">Not</span> easy to use. - Updated Dec 27, 2018 </br>

		<br>Extremly <a class="emoji"><span class="color-change">bad</span></a> service for laptop. - Updated Dec 26, 2018 </br>

		<br><span class="instagram">Instagrams</span> staff is <a class="emoji"><span class="color-change">useless</span></a> and <span class="fakelink">wont</span> help anyone in anyway. Many accounts are being deleted and <a class="emoji"><span class="color-change">hacked</span></a>but <span class="instagram">instagram</span> wont do anything about it! - Updated Dec 5, 2018 </br>

		<br>Honestly <a class="emoji"><span class="color-change">awful</span></a> customer service and full of bugs. They'll <span class="fakelink">never</span> get back about reports either, so it's clear they <span class="fakelink">don't</span> care about their users. The only redeeming factors are the few features that work. - Updated Jul 11, 2018</br>

		<br>Extremely hard to find the customer support,my account was <a class="emoji"><span class="color-change">hacked</span></a>,and contact their support email,there's <span class="fakelink">no</span> response always. - Updated Jun 26, 2018 </br>

		<br>Ridiculous changes every week just let me pick what I want on my timeline I will delete because I'm <a class="emoji"><span class="color-change">sick</span> of you force feeding me things I <span class="fakelink">do not</span> want to see where is my right to freedom of choice I've tried to communicate with you but you just <a class="emoji"><span class="color-change">ignore</span></a> me. - Updated Jun 13, 2018 </br>

		<br>I <a class="emoji"><span class="color-change">cant</span></a> log in due to a changed phone number and i tried everything but since i <span class="fakelink">didnt</span> link my FB account there is no way to log back in... i hate <span class="instagram">Instagram</span></a>. - Updated May 9, 2018 </br>

		<br>Customer service is basically <a class="emoji"><span class="color-change">non-existent</span></a> if anything goes wrong. - Updated Apr 30, 2018 </br>

		<br>Its very easy to get <a class="emoji"><span class="color-change">hacked</span></a> and every time your page gets hacked you have to start all
