		<br>Don’t think it’s right when people put <span class="color-change">inappropriate</span> pics on Instagram or <span class="color-change">inappropriate</span> messages. - Updated Jan 9, 2019 </br>

		<br>Extremly <span class="color-change">bad</span> service for laptop. - Updated Dec 26, 2018 </br>

		<br><span class="instagram">Instagrams</span> staff is <span class="color-change">useless</span> and wont help anyone in anyway. Many accounts are being deleted and <span class="color-change">hacked</span> but <span class="instagram">instagram</span> wont do anything about it! - Updated Dec 5, 2018 </br>

		<br>Honestly <span class="color-change">awful</span> customer service and full of bugs. They'll never get back about reports either, so it's clear they don't care about their users. The only redeeming factors are the few features that work. - Updated Jul 11, 2018</br>

		<br>Extremely hard to find the customer support,my account was <span class="color-change">hacked</span>,and contact their support email,there's no response always. - Updated Jun 26, 2018 </br>

		<br>Customer service is basically <span class="color-change">non-existent</span> if anything goes wrong. - Updated Apr 30, 2018 </br>

		<br>Its very easy to get <span class="color-change">hacked</span> and every time your page gets hacked you have to start all over again!! It is so annoying!! - Updated Apr 3, 2018
